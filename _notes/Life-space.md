# Life-space and career formation

- A career is a sequence of positions that a person occupies determined throughout different life stages. It is a constellation of varying roles that interact constituting the career.
- A role is defined by expectations and performance. Expectations from observers and the conceptions of the player. Performance can be defined as two definitions: delivering expectations at an agreed standard and shaping of the role, as both it and the expectations of others are redefined by the actor better to suit the developing conception of the role. It is in **role shaping**, as well as in the **choice** of positions and roles, that the individual acts as the synthesizer of personal and situational role determinants.
- People typically have 9 roles in their life which consists of being the following
	1. Child
	2. Student
	3. Leisurite
	4. Citizen
	5. Worker
	6. Spouse
	7. Homemaker
	8. Parent
	9. Pensioner
- They tend to exist within the following “theatres”
	1. Home
	2. Community
	3. Institution (School or University) 
	4. Workplace
- Each role takes place within one theatre normally however, some may intersect into others for example, a worker can take work home or the a parent can be within an institution. This can either be enriching or otherwise conflicting for the people playing the roles and sometimes others people within the theatres.
- It is the ***occupation*** in a ***theatre*** that casts a person into a ***role*** 
- Life roles existing at once will constitute a persons ***lifestyle*** 
- The sequential combination structures a ***life space*** which constitutes the ***life cycle*** making up the structure being ***career pattern***
- Roles can change and flexibly will over time depending on how we prioritise them. Where we work and live or “theatres” can stop and change. 
- Work often gives us a schedule and gives us meaning; it helps to regulate us and opens us up to social opportunities and networking. This is also true for home life.

## Life cycle and Career Patterns: The Waxing and Waning of Roles

- The waxing and waining of roles is due to level of importance we might place on a specific role at a given life stage. For instance, when entering the workforce after study we might place more time and energy in that specific theatre or playing that role. 
- This makes all other areas suffer as we tend to spend more of our resources in one theatre

- We make career decisions based on our own self-conceptions
