## Self-efficacy

The concept of self efficacy is the focal point of Albert Bandura’s social cognitive theory.

and actions. Among the beliefs with which an individual evaluates the control over
his/her actions and environment, self-efficacy beliefs are the most influential predictor of
human behavior. 

The level and strength of self-efficacy will determine:
 whether coping behavior will be initiated;
 how much effort will result;
 how long the effort will be sustained in the face of obstacles.
