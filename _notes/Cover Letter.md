# ‘Business problems are people problems’

I echo this statement above from a dear colleague of mine from my previous role as a Digital Producer and still hold this to be true. 


We believe that a successful project is rooted in a deep understanding of its objectives and we take great care to listen to our clients, often forging long-term relationships. Although our approach has been cited as original and un-conventional, our underlying principles are clarity, simplicity and a belief that functional need and emotional response demand equal consideration.

We enjoy exploring the physical possibilities of design, which has naturally extended our work into product, exhibition and environmental design. We often use non-standard materials and production methods, exploiting our knowledge of niche manufacturers and forgotten techniques, as well as new technologies.

I admire the integrity and values of Aesop and I find traits in the Aesop philosophy that truly resonate with
me. It would be an incredible opportunity and privilege to be part of the Aesop journey, and join the company
as a Retail Project Coordinator.

I graduated from RMIT University with a Bachelor in Communication (Professional). From this degree, I developed cross-disciplinary skills in writing (journalism), visual media with a particular focus on documentary filmmaking.

Alongside earning my degree, I worked for Apple Inc.
- People and processes were extremely thorough which taught to me the importance of alignment 
- Being part of a larger organisation allowed me to appreciate feedback and improvement as an opportunity
- Working with technology that needs to access 


I’ve been working in customer service for brands that 

Building a career with Aesop



My most recent role at Arinex Pty Ltd has offered me invaluable project management skills. As a Project
Coordinator, I assist the Project Manager in planning, executing and finalising large scale projects, from an
event management perspective. I’m involved in the management of six separate projects, with a wide range
of stakeholders and high end clients. In this fast paced and high pressure role, it is critical that I maintain
unwavering attention to detail and meticulous organisational skills in order to deliver projects according to
plan. My day to day tasks include liaison with clients and suppliers, management of project budgets,
coordination of meetings and subsequent documentation of meeting outcomes, management of multiple
email inboxes, as well as carrying out various administrative tasks in accordance with the current lifecycle of
the project plan.

Many years of customer service experience, combined with a natural ability to engage with those around me,
has helped foster the ability to develop strong relationships with my coworkers and clients. In my current
role, I work with a wide range of clients, from cardiologists to speech pathologists, who each have different
expectations and approaches. As such, I understand the importance of knowing my audience and tailoring my communication accordingly. Furthermore, my years working within the hotel industry exposed to me to a
number of cross functional roles, and instilled in me the drive to go that extra mile to develop relationships
with my colleagues in order to reach our common goal. I am very confident in my ability to engage and build
relationships with coworkers, suppliers and clients, and pride myself on my interpersonal skills.

Whilst I do not have formal qualifications in PMBOK, Prince2 or Agile, my industry experience has provided
me with a strong understanding in project management, and I feel this would be extremely valuable to
Dwayne and the Aesop Retail Project Management team. Furthermore, should I be successful in this position,
I would certainly be willing to acquire these qualifications in my personal time.
I understand that you will receive many applications for the role of Retail Project Coordinator. I do, however,
believe that my passion for the Aesop philosophy, aligned personal values and pre-existing experience (and
love of Aesop products) will enable me to become a valuable and supportive team member, who will work
hard to help produce high quality project outcomes for Aesop.
Thank you for taking the time to read through my application. I would very much appreciate the opportunity
to meet with you to discuss this further. Please feel welcome to contact me if you have any questions.
