triadic reciprocal causation

>Rather, they make causal contribution to their own motivation and action within a system of triadic reciprocal causation. In this model of reciprocal causation, action, cognitive, affective, and other personal factors, and environmental events all operate as interacting determinants. Any account of the determinants of human action must, therefore, include self-generated influences as a contributing factor.

>The successful, the innovative, the sociable, the nonanxious, the nondespondent, and the social reformers take an optimistic view of their personal efficacy to exercise influence over events that affect their lives (Bandura, 1986; Taylor & Brown, 1988). If not unrealistically exaggerated, such self-beliefs foster the perseverant effort needed for personal and social accomplishments. The findings of laboratory studies are in accord with the records of human triumphs regarding the centrality of the motivational effects of self-beliefs of efficacy in human attainments. It takes a resilient sense of efficacy to override the numerous dissuading impediments to significant accomplishments.

>The role of perceived self-efficacy and anxiety arousal in the causal structure of avoidant behavior has also been examined extensively. The results show that people base their actions on self-perceptions of coping efficacy in situations they regard as risky. The stronger the perceived coping efficacy, the more venturesome the behavior, regardless of whether self-perceptions of efficacy are enhanced through mastery experiences, modeling influences, or cognitive simulations (Bandura, 1988b). 

Any factor that influences choice behavior can profoundly affect the direction of personal development because the social influences operating in the environments that are selected continue to promote certain competencies, values, and interests long after the decisional determinant has rendered its inaugurating effect. Thus, seemingly in consequential determinants can initiate selective associations that produce major and enduring personal changes
(Bandura, 1986; Snyder, 1986).


The power of self-efficacy beliefs to affect the course of life paths through selection processes is clearly revealed in studies of career decision-making and career development (Betz & Hackett, 1986; Lent & Hackett, 1987).

The more efficacious people judge themselves to be, the wider the range of career options they consider appropriate and the better they prepare themselves educationally for different occupational pursuits. Self-limitation of career development arises more from perceived self-inefficacy than from actual inability. By constricting choice behavior that can cultivate interests and competencies, self-disbeliefs create their own validation.

The capacity to extrapolate future consequences from known facts enables people to take corrective actions to avert disastrous futures. It is the expanded time perspective and symbolization of futures afforded by cognition that increase the prospects of human survival. Had humans been ruled solely by immediate consequences, they would have long ago destroyed most of the ecological supports of life. Forethought often saves us from the perils of a foreshortened perspective. However, the power of anticipative control must be enhanced by developing better methods for forecasting distal consequences and stronger social mechanisms for bringing projected consequences to bear on current behavior to keep us off self-destructive courses.
