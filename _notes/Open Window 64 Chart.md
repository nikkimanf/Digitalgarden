# Harada: Open Window 64 Chart

### Organisation

Why? 

I want to improve my routines around organisation and reduce any stresses that occur such as being late or financial woes. Most of my problems stem from an inability to prioritise well. 

Good at rationally explaining things to the others and asking their cooperation.


15. Keep a journal and think ahead my plan for the next day's time management and actions.
25. Predict possible future problems and come up with countermeasures beforehand.
14. Have my own knacks of how to do things well.
24. Communicate and listen to the others using emails, letters, dairy diaries, etc.
1. Always have a grasp of my day's schedule in advance.
9. Able to change my focus rather quickly in a positive way.
23. Thoroughly have everyone in the workplace follow through its rules.
30. In carrying out a project, I envision a successful image in my mind.
33. Incorporate exercises in my routines to maintain my health.
34. For those who failed, I guide them effectively so as to utilise their experience next time.
21. Practice being punctual, clean the space, and staying courteous.
