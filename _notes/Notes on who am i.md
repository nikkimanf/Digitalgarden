 - this quality is influenced by at least four components: 
	 - (a) intrinsic interest in, and enjoyment of, the task
	 - (b) the utility of the task in facilitating one’s long range goals or in helping the individual obtain immediate or long-range external rewards
	 - (c) attainment value or the value an activity has because engaging in it is consistent with one’s self-image and personal and collective/social identities; 
	 - (d) the cost of engaging in the activity in terms of financial and emotional costs, as well as in terms of the potential meaning of the behavior for either disconfirming a salient personal or collective identity or preventing one from engaging in other behaviors that are key to confirming a salient personal or collective/social identity.
 - These results suggest that although expectations for success and personal efficacy do predict occupational choice, they are not the only predictors. The evidence suggests that positive expectations are a necessary but not sufficient predictor of occupational choice. Believing that one can succeed at an occupation is critical to one’s decision to enter that occupational field. But, as predicted by the Eccles et al. model of task choice, which particular occupation one selects also appears to depend on the value one attaches to various occupational characteristics. These findings support the hypothesis that individuals select the occupation that fits best with their hierarchy of  **occupationally-relevant values**
