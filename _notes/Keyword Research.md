# Keyword Difficulty and 

## **What is the Keyword Difficulty?**

Keyword difficulty essentially means how much competition there is for that particular keyword. It measures how difficult it is for you to rank for that keyword. The higher the competition, the higher the keyword difficulty, and the more difficult it is to rank for that keyword.

Keyword difficulty is an essential metric to check while deciding which keywords to target. You shouldn’t target extremely high-competition keywords because it is challenging to rank for those terms. You also don’t want to go for extremely low-competition keywords because those usually don’t have very high search volumes.

So, it is essential to maintain a balance between **search volume and keyword difficulty**. Ideally, you would want to target moderate-competition or low-competition keywords with good search volumes.

## **What is the Keyword Difficulty Score and Why Does it Matter?**

The keyword difficulty score (KDS) is the metric that you need to check to assess keyword difficulty. A lot of SEO analytics tools provide this metric, but this is not an official Google metric.

Thus, these are your best best when it comes to selecting the right keywords as you have a realistic chance to compete for these. And, they also have a high search volume, it is worth your time to target these.

### **KDS Below 30% - Low Difficulty Keywords**

These are the low-difficulty keywords that are the easiest to rank on. However, more often than not, these keywords don’t have high and steady search volumes. But, if you can identify low-difficulty keywords with decent search volumes, then you’ve hit the jackpot.

They look for niche, [long-tail keywords that are most relevant](https://www.spyfu.com/blog/identify-long-tail-keywords/) to their business and craft content around those. Long-tail keywords are more specific to the user's search, so they are likely to have higher conversion rates. They usually have lower difficulty scores and less competition on the search engine results page (SERP), making them easier to rank for compared to broad keywords.
