#### Generating Ideas for Your Mission and Vision

A useful mission and vision statement should include two pieces: what you wish to accomplish and contribute and who you want to be, the character strengths and qualities you wish to develop. While this sounds simple, those pieces of information are not always obvious. Try these tools for generating valuable information about yourself.

Part I

**Describe your ideal day. This is not about being practical. It is designed to include as many sides of you and your enthusiasms as possible: creative, competent, artistic, introverted, extraverted, athletic, playful, nurturing, contemplative, and so on.**

==An ideal day looks like waking up fresh and energised. I’d begin the day by getting up early and beginning with a ritual such as exercise, yoga or meditation. With a gentle mind, I’d plan my day, sitting down with my planner thinking about the possibilities for the day ahead. At every moment, I am understanding of how my presence and what I do today impacts another. I clean up, consider the other person.==

==With a clear vision, I’d head to that dedicated space either meeting people face-to-face who will be part of that day’s plan or another dedicated space where I have decided which environment would be best to enable me to do what has to be done. There is no tension, I am flexible with what needs to be done and commit to what I am capable of and communicate as needed. I am able to give each moment the energy and attention it needs. When being around people I am able to give each person my undivided attention. Being fully present with them and being able to give them my time and company.==

**Imagine yourself 132 years old and surrounded by your descendants or those descendants of your friends. You are in a warm and relaxed atmosphere (such as around a fireplace). What would you say to them about what is important in life? This exercise is designed to access the values and principles that guide your life.**

- ==Be present, engage your senses==
- Build a life worth living
- ==Nothing exists in isolation==
- ==Love and be loved in return==

Imagine that it is your 70th birthday (or another milestone in your life). You have been asked by national print media to write a press release about your achievements. Consider what you would want your family, friends, coworkers in your profession and in your community to say about you. What difference would you like to have made in their lives? How do you want to be remembered? This is designed to inventory your actions and accomplishments in all areas of your life.

Part II

Review your notes for these three exercises. With those responses in mind, reflect on questions 1, 2, and 3 above. Then write a rough draft (a page of any length) of your mission statement. Remember that it should describe what you want to do and who you want to be. This is not a job description. Carry it with you, post copies in visible places at home and work, and revise and evaluate. Be patient with yourself. The process is as important as the outcome. After a few weeks, write another draft. Ask yourself whether your statement was based on proven principles that you believe in, if you feel direction, motivation, and inspiration when you read it. Over time, reviewing and evaluating will keep you abreast of your own development.
