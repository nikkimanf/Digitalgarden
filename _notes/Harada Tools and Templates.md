# Harada Tools for success

[[33 Questions for Self-Reliance]]
  
A worksheet that ranks all of your capabilities and allows you to see where you need improvement based on the given values. 

This is completed by **Step 2** in the [[Harada Process]].
  
[[Long-Term Goal Form]]
  
The heart of the Harada Method. This form is the main tool that organizes your goals and purposes, your self-analysis and your action plan. During the LTGF we perform a thorough analysis. The analysis part of the form brings forward past obstacles to your success, and outlines countermeasures for future success. It also helps you plan tasks and routines for success.
  
Open Window 64 Chart – a framework for coming up with the tasks and routines you need to complete to accomplish your goals.

[[Week-Routine-Check-Sheet.jpeg | Routine Check Sheet]]  – a daily checklist to help you strengthen your habits.

Daily Diary – a planning tool that helps you organise each day to improve your productivity. It also teaches you to reflect on each day so that you can gauge your daily progress.
