# Local Packs


Local packs are different from other SERP features because [the algorithm that decides which sites get to be in a local pack](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091) isn’t the same as Google’s regular one. 

The local search algorithm decides to put somewhere in a local map pack based on three factors: 

1. **Relevance**: how relevant the result is to a searcher’s intent 
2. **Prominence**: how popular a business is 
3. **Distance**: how far each result is from the search query 

Google figures out each largely based on a site’s [off-page SEO](https://www.semrush.com/blog/off-page-seo/). What other sites say about a place can affect placement in a local pack—like backlinks, directories, and reviews. Google offers these tips about improving a site for local pack placement.

- Improve regular organic search positions on the SERP through keyword research 
- Optimize your [Google Business Profile](https://www.semrush.com/blog/google-my-business/) with the most recent and relevant information (address, phone number, category, and attributes) 
- Add photos to your Google Business Profile and encourage visitors/customers to do the same 
- Manage inaccurate information listed in directories 
- Add [schema markup](https://www.semrush.com/blog/what-is-schema-beginner-s-guide-to-structured-data/) to your site to help search engines understand what a business does and where it’s located 
- Get good reviews and ratings 
- Always respond to reviews 

There isn’t a foolproof way to snag a place in the local map pack. But understanding how [local SEO](https://www.semrush.com/blog/what-is-local-seo/) works can boost your chances.
