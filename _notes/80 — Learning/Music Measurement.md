**How can I calculate the number of bars in a song if I know its BPM and length?**

This can be done with reasonable accuracy only if the meter is known, the meter doesn’t change, and the tempo remains the same throughout the song.

Given these conditions, you could use the formula 𝑙(𝑟/𝑡)=𝑏, where 𝑙
 is the length of the song in minutes, 𝑟
 is the rate (beats per minute), 𝑡
 is the number of beats in a measure, and 𝑏
 is the number of bars (measures).

So, if a song is in 4/4, lasts exactly 5 minutes, and has a tempo of 80 beats per minute, the song is 100 bars long (5(80/4)=100). If the same song is in 3/4, the song is 133.33 bars long (5(80/3)=133.33).
