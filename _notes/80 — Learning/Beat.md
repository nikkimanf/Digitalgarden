# BEAT

The beat of a song is simply the pulse of the song. If you listen carefully each song will have a regular beat (you can tap your foot to work it out). A beat should never change its pattern, making it distinct from[[Rhythm.md.md| rhythm]].

Measured in beats per minute (bpm)

60 bpm = **1** **beat** per second - _a song at 60 bpm would be considered slow_  

```metronome

```


120 bpm = **2 beats** per second - _a song at 120 bpm would be twice as fast as 60, a medium speed

```metronome
bpm: 120
meter: 4/4 
size: small
```


240 bpm = **4 beats per second** - a song at 240 bpm would be considered very fast

```metronome
