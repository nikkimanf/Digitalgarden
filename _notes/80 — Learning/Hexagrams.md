Individual Hexagrams

This page presents excerpts of the descriptions of the individual hexagrams from the Taoist Yi Ching, by Liu Yiming. Descriptions of all hexagrams are related to the firing process. Some hexagrams represent that the firing process is occuring, others that one is far away from the firing process. Some hexagrams are about the balance or inbalance of yin (flexibilty) and yand (firmness).

The Can Tong Qi (Triplex Unity, 2nd century Taoist text) sees the hexagrams #1 The Creative and #2 Earth as crucible and furnace and hexagrams #29 Mastering Pitfalls and #30 Fire as the medicinal ingredients. Therefore the rest of the remaining 60 hexagrams stand for the firing times. -- Yu Yan (13th c. Taoist master, Commentary on Cantong Qi - 2nd c. Taoist text)

On the one hand the hexagrams speak about reaching pure yang by employing the firing process to burn away false yin. One the other hand, doing this requires the balance of yin (flexibilty) and yand (firmness).

The sixty-four hexagrams of the I Ching, with three hundred and eighty-four lines, only elucidate the modes of yin and yang, and the representations of balance and imbalance. If you understand the meaning of balance and imbalance of yin and yang, you can harmonise yin and yang, spontaneously fitting in with the symbols of the hexagrams. Nevertheless, the deluded who do not investigate this meaning instead cling to the symbols; they do not know that when the adepts have spoken of Difficulty (hexagram #3 ䷂) in the morning and practising Darkness (hexagram #4 ䷃) at night, this is to teach people that the arising of yang is difficult and the falling of yang is darkness. Settled (hexagram #63 ䷾)and Unsettled (hexagram #64 ䷿) teach people that when yin and yang are joined, that is being settled, and when yin and yang have not yet joined, that is being unsettled. The meanings concealed in these hexagrams are the meanings of these four hexagrams; considered in this light, the other sixty hexagrams are all permutations of yin and yang. Understanding the symbol, forget the words — the idea is clear of itself. If you understand the meaning of the hexagram symbols, the pivot of heaven is in your hand, the axis of earth depends on your mind . Wherever you go, everywhere is the Tao — there is no need to cling to the hexagram symbols, for you spontaneously accord with them.
-- Liu Yiming, commentary on Understanding Reality
