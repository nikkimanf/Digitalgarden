# RHYTHM

Rhythm is defined as ‘*the pattern of movement in time*’. In music, rhythm is the structure or flow of occurring over time. It is built off the [[Beat | beat]] which is why we usually count down before playing.

It is different to[[Beat | beat]] whereby the beat remains the same over time and is equally distributed similar to a regular heartbeat. Rhythms do not have to be regular and can have different patterns.
