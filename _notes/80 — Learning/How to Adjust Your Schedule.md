Okay now that we've talked about setting up your schedule, this is how you want to adjust your schedule. Because in all honesty it's likely going to shift slightly. A project schedule can be pretty fickle and it's about defining your schedule and realizing that the actual shape and scope of the project has changed and project A might have evolved to become project B. It might have a totally different set of features, it might have different goals, it might have different stakeholders, and it might have a different cadence altogether. So your stakeholder priorities may have shifted or you might just need more time to complete the complex functionality that you came up with together. You might have lost a designer or developer along the way which puts a snag in your deadline. 

So with all these shifting variables how do you adjust a project schedule in real time and then keep it accurate? 

So we want to make sure that we want to watch for red flags. This is something we'll talk about in more detail in our next lesson. But you're basically asking yourself two questions at any given time; 

Is something wrong? 

Or will something go wrong? 

Each of these will tell you what to watch for, these are clues that you shouldn't ignore and signs that your project schedule will probably need to shift. So, if new stakeholders or new opinions chime in, if you have changes in your project or organizational goals or vision, if you have hidden functionality or a new complexity is discovered, if you notice scope creep like gold plating, or effort creep, business creep, or even hope creep, if feedback is delayed and stakeholders go quiet. One classic example is if you work with content but you don't create the content and so you're asking your stakeholders to create it for the project, they will inevitably take longer than you think cause content writing is difficult and it's time consuming. You might also have sudden change requests that start flooding in after that initial review period. Or you might notice things like stakeholder misalignment or just a lack of clarity around who's doing what. You might also experience the swoop-and-poop from executive stakeholders. So they might just come down halfway through the project and suddenly say, nope I don't like that direction, we need to change it. So at this point you're looking at these things will impact your schedule and it's your job to clarify how and how much. So one thing you need to be able to do is to negotiate more time. So instead of just coming to a stakeholder and saying, we need more time. You probably want to come prepared with a reason. You want to go in and you want to be able to follow your strategy and plan the conversation that you need to have immediately. Just note that the longer you wait, the worse things are going to get, the more time that you're going to end up needing. 

So be prepared to answer the following questions; 

Why did this happen? 
How much time do you need? 
How does this change affect the project timeline, the resources and the budget? 

Talk about what happens if you don't add additional time. Usually this is going to mean that your team is going to burnout, or you're going to create lower quality work. Or the outcomes are going to suffer in some way. Then you want to ask for support, so you want to start with your team and you want to work outwards from there. So again if you're dealing with executive stakeholders or if you're dealing with external stakeholders on the client's side, you want to ask them for their support and their help because this change is something you've worked hard to try to stop or mitigate but it is something that you need to accommodate for. Just like risk happening on projects being normal, changes to the schedule are often very normal and we just need to look at how we're going to accommodate for those. Here are some things you want to consider when you are adjusting your schedule. 

You're going to have to ask yourself a few questions before you're doing it because in some cases you're not going to have the freedom to adjust it the way you'd like it. So here's some things you should think about before you have these conversations; did we make a mistake or should we adjust the budget? 

Is this a stakeholder delay that we should renegotiate budget for? So again, where did this delay happen? 

Is it internal, external? 
Is it something we could prevent or not? 
Is there a firm launch or a public campaign that makes moving this date impossible?


So your only option if there is a firm launch is to reduce the scope. You can always go back and add more scope later but unforeseen complexity means that you have to prioritize the most important things first. 

Can we shrink the scope of what needs to be finished at launch and add additional features after launch? If the answer is no, then you need to commit to all of the things that you were supposed to do before you had this sudden crunch for time or this schedule change. Then we need to look at moving other project tasks or other scope requirements or even other distractions out of the way so that we can focus and get things done. So maybe we book out a whole week or a whole sprint and we just focus on getting the work done on this project by having conversations with other stakeholders on other projects and saying, hey we're going to temporarily slow down on yours until we can get this out of the way so that we can give you our full focus.

Does the team have capacity to switch projects or pick up additional work for this project? So often when you're looking at a change in your schedule, your teammate might not have the ability to work more because they're already working too much. Or they might just be working across too many projects. So you have to be really honest about if this is a possibility. You're going to protect your team and make sure that you're championing their best work and supporting them so they're not getting burnt out. 

You have to ask yourself; is this project going to be profitable? Or if you're not client services or any sort of service-based company, is it going to be sustainable if we adjust the schedule? 

In other words, if we change this can we still be successful together? And then if you're looking, finally, at sales or intake if they undersold it or under-scoped a project, what power do you have to renegotiate or reset expectations? 

In many cases you have more power than you think you do. Just do have another conversation, just really getting alignment with people that are deciding what is happening and how fast that work needs to happen.
