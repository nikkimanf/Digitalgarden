It is said that where the handle of the big dipper points is auspicious, while were it sits is inauspicious. What I realize as I observe this is the Tao of turning around  
the working of energy.  
  
The energy of strength in people may be likened to the handle of the Big Dipper in the sky: When the energy of strength is used outwardly, it is outwardly auspicious but inwardly inauspicious: when the energy of strength is used inwardly, it is inwardly auspicious but outwardly inauspicious. This is like the astrological belief that where the handle of the Big Dipper points is auspicious, while where it sits is inauspicious.  
  
After people are born and get mixed up in temporal conditioning, their strength is all used outwardly in the struggle to prevail and the desire for power. They accept the false and abandon the real, which is injurious to the inner treasures of vitality, energy and spirit. Thus, beneficial energy is dispersed outwardly, while harmful energy is taken in. Over a long period of time the positive (yang) is exhausted and the negative (yin) becomes total – thus death is inevitable.  
  
Therefore advanced people turn the dipper handle around, in the sense that they use strength inwardly to destroy the three corpses, get rid of the six robbers, cut off the ten thousand things and sweep away the dust. Not letting the false damage the real, not letting externals disturb them inwardly, beneficial energy grows day by day, while harmful energy disappears day by day. Eventually beneficial energy is pure and harmful energy is gone. So that they are able to live long. -- _Liu Yiming (18th C. Taoist master, Awakening the Tao)_
