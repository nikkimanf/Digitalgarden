# 33 Questions for Self-reliance

There are 33 questions that a person answers that gauge how self reliant the individual is. Against each of these questions (i.e., descriptors), individuals should rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 10, with “1” as “not an accurate description” and “10” as “the most accurate description” of themselves. This is a tool for self-assessment only – there is no score that an individual is attempting to achieve. By assessing themselves according to these descriptors, the individual becomes more self-aware and is able to better understand where they need to focus their time and energies. The ultimate goal with this form is to reach a “10” with each descriptor – then individuals are 100 percent confident in their self-reliance.
