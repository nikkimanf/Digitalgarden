First and most important - you have to believe in yourself and that you are capable of becoming an astronaut. You drop off any doubt. You know that you have a lot of hard work in front of you, but you are confident and willing to do whatever is necessary to attain your goal.

You evaluate yourself on a scale of one to ten using the 33 self-reliant words. Then you determine what you will do to move up your capability on those words where you score yourself less than ten.

You clearly define your goal and your vision for the future. You write down exactly what you want to do as an astronaut and the date when you want to become one (e.g., "By March 2018, I want to be an astronaut studying the relationship between weightlessness and bone density"). vision for what you will become in the future.

You develop interim goals with specific measures and dates to monitor your progress. The interim goals remind you when you have to finish certain key things if you want to reach your overall goal on time (e.g., “I want to finish my Ph.D. in physiology by 2016").

"make enough money as an astronaut to pay off my student loans from the Ph.D. program intangible benefit might be that you will be awed  by the feeling of seeing Earth from outer space for the first time. I know that I Will be a very happy person as I strive for my goal and when I attain it. You will state the purpose of attaining your goal for others: the world will become a safer  as countries cooperate to study the value of developing outer space stations." "My family will be very proud of my accomplishments."

You write a list of routines that you will do this month to do daily (or almost daily) to build new patterns that keep you on the right path. You develop the routine list to reinforce positive behaviors. The routines can come from: your 33 self-reliant words, an analysis of your past successes or failures or from the tasks on the 64-chart (e.g., "I will work late in the lab two days a week, or “I will spend 30 minutes each day reading the latest medical research on the effects of gravity on the human body"). You want to create new habits or behaviors to continually move closer and closer to your goal even when you are not consciously thinking about it.

You write down the kind of support you will need from others to attain your goals and also you will indicate the kind of support you might need (e.g., "I will need Dr. Ellsbury to teach me how to set up a bone density monitoring experiment").

You keep a daily diary showing your schedule for each day. The diary helps you organize your time and to focus on the most important tasks for each day. It also gives you a space for daily reflection so you can prepare better for the next day. Over time, using the diary your, habits and incorporates the Harada Method
your daily life.

Lastly you work with a coach/mentor to help you perform the tasks needed to succeed. Without a coach you might lose your will and allow yourself to fall back to previous habits.
